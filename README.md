# typing-test-javascript
This project generates a random test sentence on every window load event. The user has to click on the ‘Start Test’ button and start typing in the provided text area. The characters entered correctly are turned into green colour while wrong ones are turned into red.
The application shows two stats. The first is a countdown timer of 60seconds, and the second is the mistakes counter. For every mistake the user makes while typing, the mistake counter increase by one.
